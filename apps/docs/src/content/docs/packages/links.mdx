## Install

```bash
npm install @ccbd-seo/links @ccbd-seo/core
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { buildLinkGraph, findOrphanPages, suggestLinks } from '@ccbd-seo/links';

const pages = [
  { url: 'https://example.com/', links: ['https://example.com/about', 'https://example.com/blog'] },
  { url: 'https://example.com/about', links: ['https://example.com/'] },
  { url: 'https://example.com/blog', links: ['https://example.com/'] },
  { url: 'https://example.com/orphan', links: [] },
];

const graph = buildLinkGraph(pages);
console.log(graph.nodes.size); // 4

const orphans = findOrphanPages(graph);
console.log(orphans); // [{ url: 'https://example.com/orphan', inboundCount: 0 }]

const suggestions = suggestLinks(graph, {
  maxSuggestions: 5,
});
// [{ from: '...', to: '...', reason: '...' }, ...]
```

### Link Equity Analysis

```typescript
import { analyzeLinkEquity } from '@ccbd-seo/links';

const equity = analyzeLinkEquity(graph);
// Scores each page based on inbound link count and depth from root
```
