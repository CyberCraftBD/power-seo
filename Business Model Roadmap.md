# power-seo Roadmap — Reputation‑First Monetization

> **Principle:** Reputation and user trust come first.
> **Rule:** All npm packages stay free forever. Paid value is added gradually through **depth, scale, and AI intelligence**, never by restricting existing features.

This roadmap defines **what ships when**, **why it is safe**, and **how revenue scales sustainably**.

---

## 0. Strategic Adjustments

Before the roadmap, here are **two critical refinements** to maximize long‑term trust and revenue:

### A. Monetize _Intelligence_, Not _Capabilities_

- Never charge for _having_ a feature
- Charge for:
  - **Depth** (multiple keywords)
  - **Scale** (bulk automation, dynamic image conversion)
  - **Intelligence** (AI reasoning, content generation, ROI prediction)

This avoids backlash and aligns with how professional SEO tools are accepted.

### B. Delay "Hard" Monetization Until Trust Signals Exist

Trust signals required **before paid rollout**:

- 1,000+ weekly npm installs
- 50+ GitHub contributors / issues
- Real‑world case studies (even small)

Paid rollout starts only **after** these signals appear.

## AI Credit System

### Text Credits

All AI text functions across all 17 packages draw from a **single unified credit pool**.
Credits are included monthly with each plan and can be purchased separately at any time.

**1 credit ≈ 1,000 AI tokens** (combined input + output, GPT‑4o‑mini default)

| Operation | Package | Credits | User cost |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Meta title generation (5 variants) | `meta` | 2 | $0.02 |
| Meta description generation | `meta` | 3 | $0.03 |
| Content analysis AI feedback | `content-analysis` | 8 | $0.08 |
| Readability AI suggestions | `readability` | 6 | $0.06 |
| AI link suggestions | `links` | 7 | $0.07 |
| AI tracking insight | `tracking` | 10 | $0.10 |
| AI analytics opportunity report | `analytics` | 12 | $0.12 |
| Image alt text rewrite (per image) | `images` | 1 | $0.01 |
| Content writing (per 500 words) | `ai` | 10 | $0.10 |

### Text Credit Top‑Up Packs (Buy Any Time, Any Plan)

| Pack | Credits | Price | Per 1K credits | Discount |

| Pro | 5,000 | $30 | $6.00 | 40% |
| Bulk | 20,000 | $100 | $5.00 | 50% |

> Top‑up credits **never expire**. Monthly plan credits reset each billing cycle.

### Image Generation Credits (Separate Pool)

Image generation uses a distinct credit pool due to fundamentally higher per‑unit cost (DALL‑E 3 standard: $0.040/image).

**1 image gen credit = 1 generated image (standard 1024×1024)**

| Pack | Credits | Price | Per credit | Discount |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Basic | 10 | $3 | $0.30 | — |
| Standard | 50 | $12 | $0.24 | 20% |
| Pro | 200 | $40 | $0.20 | 33% |

### What 100 Free Credits Gets You

| Use case | Operations |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Meta titles only | ~50 title sets |
| Meta descriptions only | ~33 descriptions |
| Content AI analysis only | ~12 full analyses |
| Mixed typical usage | ~15–20 AI operations |

### AI Provider Routing

| Provider | Plans | Notes |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| CCBD AI (GPT‑4o‑mini) | All plans (default) | Cheapest, good quality for SEO |
| User's OpenAI key | Starter+ | User pays their own API costs |
| User's Anthropic key | Starter+ | User pays their own API costs |

## Reputation Protection Rules (Never Break)

- No retroactive paywalls — no existing free feature is ever removed or degraded
- No forced AI — all deterministic features work without an API key or plan
- No "best SEO ever" marketing — all AI outputs are clearly marked as assistive
- Transparent pricing — all plan limits and credit costs publicly documented
- Clear version changelogs — additions only, never removals

---

## One‑Line Strategy

**Free infrastructure builds trust.
Paid depth and scale builds early revenue.
AI credits and cloud services build long‑term scale.**

---

## Risk Analysis — Reputation & Revenue Protection

This section identifies **key risks** in monetizing power-seo and defines **mitigations** to protect long-term trust, adoption, and sustainability.

---

## 1. Open‑Source Trust Erosion

### Risk

Community may fear future paywalls or feature removal once paid features are introduced.

### Impact

- Loss of contributors
- Reduced npm adoption
- Public backlash (GitHub, X, Reddit)

### Mitigation

- Public guarantee: **All `@power-seo/*` packages remain free forever**
- Never downgrade or limit existing features
- Clear changelog showing only _additions_, never removals

---

## 2. AI Over‑Claiming (SEO Accuracy Risk)

### Risk

AI predictions perceived as promises or guarantees.

### Impact

- Legal exposure
- Loss of professional credibility
- User distrust of AI outputs

### Mitigation

- Restrict AI ROI output to:
  - Directional insights (High / Medium / Low)
  - Numeric ranges only (e.g. +10–20%)
- Mandatory disclaimer: _Estimates, not guarantees_
- Deterministic SEO logic always visible alongside AI suggestions

---

## 3. Aggressive Monetization Too Early

### Risk

Introducing paid features before community trust is established.

### Impact

- Poor conversion
- Negative sentiment
- Project abandonment

### Mitigation

- Delay paid rollout until trust signals exist:
  - Active npm installs
  - Community issues & PRs
- Conservative rollout: **1–2 paid features per minor version**

---

## 4. AI Cost Overrun

### Risk

Uncontrolled AI usage causing infrastructure losses.

### Impact

- Negative margins
- Forced price increases
- Service instability

### Mitigation

- Credit‑based AI usage — users consume what they buy
- Hard per‑request rate limits
- Daily and monthly credit caps enforced server‑side
- Credits refunded only on confirmed provider failure

---

## 5. Vendor Lock‑In (AI Providers)

### Risk

Dependency on a single LLM provider (pricing or policy changes).

### Impact

- Cost spikes
- Feature disruption

### Mitigation

- Hybrid AI routing:
  - Default: CCBD AI (GPT‑4o‑mini)
  - Optional: User's own key for any provider
- Abstracted AI adapter layer in `@power-seo/ai` — swap providers without API changes

---

## 6. API Dependency Risk (Semrush / Ahrefs)

### Risk

Third‑party API changes, pricing increases, or access limits.

### Impact

- Feature outages
- Unexpected costs

### Mitigation

- **User‑provided API keys only** — power‑seo never holds third‑party API keys
- Graceful degradation when APIs fail
- Feature clearly documented as "requires your own Semrush/Ahrefs subscription"

---

## 7. Cloud vs OSS Boundary Confusion

### Risk

Users confusing free npm libraries with paid cloud services.

### Impact

- Support burden
- Reputation damage

### Mitigation

- Clear separation in all documentation:
  - **npm packages = free forever**
  - **AI credits = pay per use**
  - **Plans = depth + scale + credit allocation**
  - **Cloud dashboard = separate paid product (Phase 6)**
- Explicit tables and diagrams in docs and README

---

## 8. Community Fragmentation

### Risk

Forks or competing projects claiming to be "more open".

### Impact

- Split ecosystem
- Reduced influence

### Mitigation

- Transparent governance
- Welcoming contribution model
- No hostile licensing
- Core logic always open — only intelligence is paid

---

## 9. Security & Data Privacy Risk (Cloud)

### Risk

Handling SEO, analytics, and AI data introduces privacy concerns.

### Impact

- Legal exposure
- Loss of enterprise trust

### Mitigation

- Minimal data retention — no content stored beyond the API request lifecycle
- Clear data ownership terms: user data is never used to train models
- Opt‑in analytics only

---

## 10. Credit System Abuse

### Risk

Users share API keys, exploit free credits, or abuse trial credits.

### Impact

- Negative margins
- Unfair to paying users

### Mitigation

- API keys are scoped to a single account (server‑validated)
- Free tier limited to 100 credits/month with no rollover
- Rate limiting per key: max 10 AI requests/minute
- Anomaly detection on unusually high usage patterns

---

## Final Risk Principle

> **Short‑term revenue must never compromise long‑term trust.**

If a monetization decision threatens reputation, it must be delayed or redesigned.

---

## Instructions for Claude

When implementing paid systems:

- Always prefer conservative defaults
- Assume public scrutiny on every feature decision
- Optimize for sustainability over speed
- All npm package functions must work without an API key for their deterministic features
- AI functions must return a clear, user‑friendly error when no API key or insufficient credits are present — never a silent failure
- The `PlanContext` object (apiKey, tier, maxKeywords, imageQuota, credits) is always optional — omitting it falls back to free‑tier behaviour
- Credit deduction must be atomic — deduct only after a successful AI response, never on failure
- Never hardcode credit costs in individual packages — costs are defined centrally in `@power-seo/ai`
